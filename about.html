    <article>I was born and raised on a farm in Montana, outside of West Hampton. I lived with my parents, my paternal grandparents, and my brother and sister. I was born January 7, 1988, as at the hospital in Helsing, the closest city with a hospital. My parents decided to name me Carl, after my grandfather. As my parents drove me home, our family truck was struck by a drunk driver as we were turning into our driveway. My mother was killed instantly, and my father had his right wrist, arm, and several of his ribs broken.
    
    It was not easy growing up without my mother. My maternal grandparents attended her funeral, and later came to live with us. Practically, I had two mother figures and three father figures growing up. My father could not look at me wihout recalling my mother's death and so was less disposed to spend time with me. Instead, he took a job some three hundred miles away in Las Vegas. It was a rather highly paying job, as he was able to purchase his own private jet and return for one week every month. Until he didn't, anyway. But that is a story for another time.
    
    My grandparents did a fine job of raising me and my siblings. We all made high grades at West Hampton Community School. Not that there was much competition, anyway. There were perhaps 50 school aged children in the whole of the West Hampton area.</article>
